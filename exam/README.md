# The project 
The project consists of exercises that require the use of data mining tools for analysis of data. Exercises include: data understanding, classification, clustering analysis, frequent pattern mining.
The project should be performed by each student independently. The output must be a Pyhton notebook such that:
(1) all experiments can be replicated by simply running all the steps
(2) the notebook must be commented enough to be self-explanatory. Please also comment on results and conclusions drawn
(3) the notebook should (not necessarily a "must") be saved with enough precomputed plots and tables to be evaluated also without running the code (that will save me from waiting minutes while my laptop recomputes everything).
No other documentation has to be produced.


# Objectives
The challenge of this competition is to predict if the car purchased at the Auction is a good / bad buy.
All the variables in the data set are defined in the file Carvana_Data_Dictionary.txt
The data contains missing values
The dependent variable (IsBadBuy) is binary (C2)
There are 32 Independent variables (C3-C34)
The data set is split to 60% training and 40% testing -- but you can change it as you wish.
